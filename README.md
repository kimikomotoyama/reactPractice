==========

Let's build a user registration form. It must ask the following information:

* user id: the user id must not already be used
* name (mandatory)
* e-mail address: it must be a valid address
* country (mandatory): must be populated using a list of countries loaded from the server

The user should not be able to hit the submit button if the form has validation errors.
